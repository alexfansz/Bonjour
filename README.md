# About this repository

* GitHub:  <https://github.com/olivierlevon/Bonjour/>


This is not another repository to track the source changes made by Apple (For that, look at https://github.com/dc7kr/mDNSResponder or https://github.com/obiltschnig/mDNSResponder, or build your own with this Ruby script : https://gist.github.com/stepheneb/470947) or a mirror of the last officially available SVN repository from Apple (Lookt at https://github.com/Sha0/mDNSResponder/commits/master).

This repository will host my fork of Apple mDNSResponder code (currently 878.30.4 from https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/) for my own use, trying to improve almost unmaintained support for Windows and Posix platforms.
Plateform code for MacOS or VxWorks have been removed.
